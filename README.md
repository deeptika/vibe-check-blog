Naturally, the 2024 presidential elections and their debates have spurred millions of conversations around the world, both online and offline.

**Vibe Check** aims to collect data and analyze it by transforming vast amounts of unstructured internet chatter into structured conclusions about public sentiment.

## Why does this matter?
Public sentiment plays a pivotal role in shaping political landscapes, particularly during significant events like the U.S. Presidential elections. In today’s digital age where freedom of speech proliferates online, engaging platforms such as YouTube provide a goldmine of real-time public discourse.

While there are conventional methods of gauging public reactions like polls and surveys, we at Vibe Check rely on already available rich discourse in the form of YouTube comments to generate data-backed insights.

By employing sophisticated data science techniques, Vibe Check efficiently processes and categorizes large volumes of textual data. This enables us to deliver insights into political biases and voter tendencies rapidly, providing a fresh and immediate snapshot of the political pulse. It also brings to light a spectrum of diverse views that might be overlooked in traditional methods.
